# Core Vision

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** Nixtia sells premium nixtamalized corn masa products (for tamales, tortillas, bread, pastries, etc.) through manual channels - primarily WhatsApp orders and social media. This creates operational challenges:

- **Manual order management:** Every transaction requires direct communication, creating bottlenecks
- **No business visibility:** Revenue, transaction patterns, and payment methods aren't tracked systematically
- **Limited scalability:** WhatsApp-based commerce can't grow beyond the owner's capacity to respond
- **Unprofessional perception:** Lack of digital presence limits market reach and credibility
- **Customer friction:** Buyers have no self-service option to browse products, check availability, or complete purchases independently

**Impact:** The business is constrained by manual processes, can't scale efficiently, and lacks the professional digital presence needed to compete in modern food e-commerce.

## Proposed Solution

A **three-tier digital platform** that professionalizes Nixtia's operations:

1. **Virtual Store (Customer-Facing):** Self-service e-commerce site where customers browse products, add to cart, select quantities, and complete checkout via multiple payment methods (bank transfer, cash/card on delivery, Stripe integration)

2. **WebApp Dashboard (Business Owner):** Secure admin interface providing real-time business intelligence - revenue charts, transaction history, payment method analytics - plus product management (CRUD)

3. **Landing Page (Marketing):** Public showcase explaining Nixtia's value proposition, product benefits, and linking to the virtual store

**Key Differentiator:** The platform is built around how Nixtia's customers actually behave - WhatsApp-first, elder-friendly, phone-based checkout with minimal friction. This isn't generic e-commerce; it's tailored to the cultural context of traditional food businesses in their market.

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Generic e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.) don't fit Nixtia's needs:

- **Over-complicated checkout:** Forcing email/password registration loses elder customers who prefer phone-based contact
- **One-size-fits-all:** Don't accommodate the WhatsApp-centric ordering culture of their customer base
- **Expensive:** Monthly fees and transaction costs eat into margins for a small food business
- **Inflexible integrations:** Can't easily connect to WhatsApp bots or customize the dual-tier UX (high security for admin, low friction for customers)
