# Session Start

**Context:** Nixtia project - MVP delivery in 2-3 days for client demo. Solo development, tight scope, development-first with polished visuals.

**Business:** Nixtia creates healthy, versatile corn-based products (masa nixtamalizada) for various cooking applications - tamales, tortillas, bread, pancakes, baking, etc. Premium quality, traditional flavors with superior nutrition.

**Three Development Components:**

1. Landing Page (public showcase)
2. WebApp (for Nixtia - dashboard, analytics, virtual store editor, product CRUD)
3. Virtual Store (for Nixtia's clients - products, cart, payments)

**Tech Assets Available:**

- Brand colors: Purple/violet palette (#4b4877, #6b4179, #241140) + accent yellow (#ffbb1c)
- Typography: TAN Headline (primary), Libre Baskerville (secondary), Poppins/Inter/Open Sauce (body)
- Logo assets (2 versions)
- Color palette image

**Tech Stack Considerations:**

- Database/API: Supabase (primary), FastAPI (if needed)
- Frontend: NextJS/React/Astro/Vue/Svelte (TBD)
- Payments: Stripe Connect (client self-service portal)
- Hosting: Vercel/Lovable/VPS

**Constraints:**

- 2-3 day delivery timeline
- Solo developer (Facundo)
- Must win client confidence
- Keep scope tight - no feature creep
- Development-first, but polished presentation
