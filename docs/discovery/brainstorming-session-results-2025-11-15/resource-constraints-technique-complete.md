# **Resource Constraints Technique - COMPLETE ✅**

**Summary of Major Decisions:**

1. ✅ **Landing Page:** All 5 sections (but lowest priority, can be cut)
2. ✅ **WebApp MVP:** Dashboard with 3 widgets (revenue chart, transactions table, payment breakdown)
3. ✅ **Store MVP:** Catalog + Cart + Quantity Selector + Details Page + Payment UI + Order Confirmation
4. ❌ **Store Eliminated:** Product search/filtering (low product density)
5. ✅ **Auth Strategy:** Full admin auth (Supabase email/password/reset) + guest checkout (phone-first)
6. ✅ **Tech Stack:** NextJS + Supabase + Stripe Connect + Vercel
7. ✅ **Demo Priority:** Apps over landing page

**🚧 SESSION CHECKPOINT - NEXT TECHNIQUE 🚧**

**Status:** Resource Constraints complete, moving to First Principles Thinking
**Current Question:** Why does Nixtia need a "WebApp dashboard" at all? What core problem does it solve that can't be handled via Supabase DB, Stripe dashboard, WhatsApp, or simple admin CRUD?
**Remaining Techniques:**
- First Principles Thinking (IN PROGRESS)
- Time Shifting
- SCAMPER Method
- Then move to convergent phase (categorization, insights, action planning)
