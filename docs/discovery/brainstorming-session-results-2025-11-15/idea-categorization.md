## Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

1. **Real customers order via WhatsApp** - This fundamentally changes UX priorities (elder-friendly, phone-first, minimal friction)
2. **"Demoable" ≠ "Fully Integrated"** - Show the journey with working UI; backend can be progressive
3. **Apps > Landing Page** - The working applications prove capability, marketing site is secondary
4. **Two-tier security model** - High security for business owner, low friction for customers
5. **Time constraint breeds clarity** - 2-3 days forced ruthless prioritization and eliminated nice-to-haves
6. **Boring tech wins in sprints** - NextJS is heavier than ideal, but eliminates decision fatigue
