# 1. Design System Foundation

## 1.1 Design System Choice

**Selected:** shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS

**Rationale:**
- Tailwind-native, aligns with Next.js tech stack
- Copy-paste components (owned code, not external dependency)
- Highly themeable — can fully apply Nixtia's brand identity
- Excellent accessibility built-in (Radix primitives under the hood)
- Professional base aesthetic that can be customized

**Customization Approach:**
- Theme shadcn/ui components with Nixtia color palette
- Apply TAN Headline / Libre Baskerville / Poppins typography
- Extend with custom components where folk art motifs are needed
- Maintain shadcn/ui patterns for consistency and accessibility
