# 4. Design Direction

## 4.1 Chosen Design Approach

**Selected Direction:** **"Spacious Card Gallery"** - Mobile-first, card-based product browsing with generous touch targets

**Layout Decisions:**

- **Navigation:** Top navigation bar (mobile: logo + cart icon, desktop: adds admin login link)
- **Content Structure:** Single column on mobile, 2-3 column grid on tablet/desktop
- **Product Organization:** Large product cards with prominent imagery

**Visual Hierarchy:**

- **Density:** Spacious - generous white space, breathing room between elements
- **Header Emphasis:** Bold TAN Headline headers with strong contrast
- **Content Focus:** Imagery-heavy for products, data-focused for admin dashboard

**Interaction Patterns:**

- **Primary Actions:** Floating "Add to Cart" button on product cards, sticky "Proceed to Checkout" in cart
- **Information Disclosure:** Progressive - cart summary slides in from right, checkout form expands inline
- **User Control:** Flexible - customers can edit cart freely, no forced steps

**Visual Style:**

- **Weight:** Balanced - clear structure with subtle shadows for card elevation
- **Depth Cues:** Subtle elevation - 2-4px shadows on cards, 8px on modals
- **Borders:** Subtle - 1px slate-300 borders on form inputs, no borders on cards (shadow only)

**Rationale:**
Elder-friendly UX demands large touch targets, clear visual hierarchy, and familiar patterns. The spacious card layout prevents accidental taps, prominent CTAs reduce cognitive load, and the mobile-first approach aligns with 80% mobile traffic. This direction balances professional credibility with approachable warmth.
