## Core Interactive Deliverables

This UX Design Specification was created through automated YOLO mode execution based on comprehensive PRD analysis:

- **Color Theme Visualizer**: [docs/ux-color-themes.html](./ux-color-themes.html) _(will be generated)_
  - Interactive HTML showing all color theme options explored
  - Live UI component examples in each theme
  - Side-by-side comparison and semantic color usage

- **Design Direction Mockups**: [docs/ux-design-directions.html](./ux-design-directions.html) _(will be generated)_
  - Interactive HTML with 6-8 complete design approaches
  - Full-screen mockups of key screens
  - Design philosophy and rationale for each direction

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions:**

1. Generate interactive color theme visualizer HTML
2. Generate design direction mockups HTML
3. Validate UX decisions against PRD requirements
4. Proceed to Architecture workflow (next in Phase 2)

**Follow-Up Workflows:**

- **create-epics-and-stories** - Break down PRD with UX context
- **architecture** - Define technical architecture informed by UX decisions
- **create-wireframe** - Generate detailed wireframes for key screens
- **implementation-readiness** - Final validation before Phase 4
