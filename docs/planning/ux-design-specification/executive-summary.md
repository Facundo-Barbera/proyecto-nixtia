# Executive Summary

Nixtia is building a complete e-commerce platform for a premium corn-based food products business. The platform transforms a WhatsApp-overwhelmed artisan business into a professional digital operation — liberating the owner from manual order chaos while meeting customers exactly where they are with frictionless, elder-friendly checkout.

**Three-Tier Platform:**
1. **Virtual Store (Customer-Facing)** — Self-service e-commerce (browse → cart → checkout)
2. **Admin Dashboard (Business Owner)** — Real-time business intelligence + product management
3. **Landing Page (Marketing)** — Public showcase with value proposition (optional MVP)

**Target Users:**
- **Primary:** End customers (home cooks, restaurants, bakeries) — WhatsApp-first, elder-friendly (40+), mobile-centric, prefer phone over email
- **Secondary:** Business owner — needs clarity, control, and mobile access

**Emotional Goals:**
- Customer journey: Curiosity → Confidence → Ease → Satisfaction
- Admin journey: Overwhelm → Clarity → Control → Empowerment

**Brand Constraint:** All design decisions must align strictly with existing Nixtia brand assets (colors, typography, logos, visual motifs) — no new brand elements.
