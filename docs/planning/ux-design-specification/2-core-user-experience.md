# 2. Core User Experience

## 2.1 Defining Experience

**Customer Store — Core Experience:**
- Users are **existing fans** migrating from WhatsApp ordering, not strangers discovering the brand
- Tiny catalog (protein tortillas + 1 additional product) — no browsing/search complexity needed
- **The ONE thing:** Order what I already want, faster than WhatsApp
- This is about **convenience and speed**, not discovery
- Effortless moment: "I want tortillas → I have tortillas ordered" in under 60 seconds

**Admin Dashboard — Core Experience:**
- Information panels must impress for the **demo/sale** to client
- Professional, polished visuals that communicate business value
- Operational automation is the real long-term value
- Effortless moment: "Wow, I can see my business" — immediate visual impact on login

## 2.2 Platform Strategy

| Interface | Primary Device | Secondary Device | Optimization Focus |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Virtual Store** | Mobile (excellent) | Desktop (smooth) | Speed, thumb-friendly, minimal steps |
| **Admin Dashboard** | Desktop (excellent) | Mobile (functional) | Visual impact, data clarity, professional feel |

**Balance goal:** Both interfaces should feel great on both devices, but each optimizes for its primary user context.

## 2.3 Emotional Design Goals

| User | Target Feeling | Design Implication |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Customer** | *"That was easy — just like texting my order"* | Familiar, fast, zero friction, no learning curve |
| **Admin** | *"Finally, I understand my business"* | Clarity, visual impact, professional confidence |

**Multi-Channel Context:** The web store is one ordering channel alongside a future WhatsApp bot. Both must feel equally effortless — customers choose their preferred method, not a "better" one.
