# Overview

This document provides the epic and story breakdown for Nixtia, accounting for the **existing codebase** with partial implementation. Epics build ON what exists, not from scratch.

**Key Brownfield Facts:**
- Store page, checkout, cart, admin login, landing page: IMPLEMENTED (with issues)
- Prisma ORM: MUST BE REMOVED (Architecture decision - use Supabase only)
- Admin dashboard: Partial (TransactionsTable exists, charts MISSING)
- Product detail page: NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Context Sources:** PRD + UX Design + Architecture
