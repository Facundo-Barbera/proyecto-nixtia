# Summary

**Epic Breakdown Complete!**

**Total Epic Count:** 4 epics
**Total Story Count:** 23 implementable stories

**Context Incorporated:**

- ✅ **PRD:** All 59 functional requirements mapped to stories
- ✅ **UX Design:** Interaction patterns, component specs, responsive breakpoints, accessibility requirements integrated into acceptance criteria
- ⏳ **Architecture:** To be added in Phase 2 Solutioning (technical stack, API contracts, data models)

**User Value Delivery:**

- **Epic 1:** Foundation enables all subsequent work (greenfield setup)
- **Epic 2:** CORE MVP - Customers can browse and purchase (eliminates WhatsApp chaos)
- **Epic 3:** Business owner sees revenue insights (operational liberation)
- **Epic 4:** Self-service product management + marketing presence (client independence)

**Epic Structure Validates User Value:**
Each epic delivers something USERS can use or benefit from. No technical-layer-only epics. Foundation exception justified for greenfield project.

**FR Coverage:** 100% of MVP-scoped functional requirements covered by stories. Post-MVP and post-demo features clearly flagged.

**Story Quality:**

- All stories vertically sliced (deliver complete functionality, not just one layer)
- BDD acceptance criteria clear and testable
- No forward dependencies (sequential order enables incremental delivery)
- UX details integrated (mockup references, interaction patterns, component specs)
- Elder-friendly and accessibility requirements embedded (44px touch targets, WCAG AA, screen readers)
- Performance targets specified (< 2s page loads, < 200ms cart updates)

**Next Steps:**

1. Run Architecture workflow to add technical decisions (API contracts, data models, tech stack details)
2. Update this epics.md with architecture context (enhancement mode)
3. Proceed to Phase 4: Sprint Planning and Implementation

_For implementation: Use the `create-story` workflow to generate individual story implementation plans from this epic breakdown. Each story will be enriched with story context XML pulling from PRD, UX, Architecture, and existing code._

_This document will be updated after Architecture workflow to incorporate technical implementation details._
