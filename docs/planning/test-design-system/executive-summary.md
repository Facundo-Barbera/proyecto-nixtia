# Executive Summary

This document establishes the testability framework and test strategy for Nixtia before entering implementation phase. The architecture (Next.js 16 + Supabase + Stripe) provides a **PASS with CONCERNS** testability rating. Core patterns support testing, but observability gaps require Sprint 0 attention.

**Testability Verdict:** PASS with CONCERNS (proceed with noted mitigations)
