# Quality Gate Criteria (Phase 3 → Phase 4)

Before proceeding to implementation:

- [x] Architecture testability review: **PASS with CONCERNS**
- [ ] Test framework initialized (Playwright + Vitest)
- [ ] Health check endpoint implemented
- [ ] Test data factories created
- [ ] CI pipeline configured for tests
- [ ] High-risk ASRs (Score ≥6) have mitigation plans assigned

**Recommendation:** Proceed to Implementation (Phase 4) with Sprint 0 addressing testability concerns.
