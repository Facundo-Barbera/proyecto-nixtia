# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Epic & Story Breakdown** - Run: `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-epics-and-stories`
2. **UX Design** - Run: `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-design` for detailed user experience design
3. **Architecture** - Run: `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-architecture` for technical architecture decisions

## Project Track

**Track:** BMad Method (Greenfield)
**Phase:** Planning (PRD Complete)

**Epic Context for Breakdown:**

This is a **dual-interface platform** requiring careful story sequencing:

- Virtual Store must be demoable before Dashboard
- Landing Page is lowest priority (can be cut)
- Mock data acceptable for demo analytics
- Real Stripe integration deferred post-demo

**Story Altitude:** Stories should focus on user-facing capabilities and vertical slices (e.g., "Customer can complete checkout flow" not "Build checkout API endpoint"). Each story should deliver testable value.
