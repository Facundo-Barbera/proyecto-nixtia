# Timeline Constraints

**Hard Deadline:** 2-3 days for demoable MVP

**Development Sequence:**

- **Day 1-2 (16-20 hours):** Virtual Store
  - Next.js project setup + Supabase integration
  - Product catalog with real data
  - Cart functionality (add/remove/quantity)
  - Checkout flow with phone collection
  - Payment method selection UI
  - Order confirmation page

- **Day 2-3 (8-12 hours):** WebApp Dashboard
  - Supabase email/password auth
  - Protected dashboard route
  - Three core widgets with mock data (revenue chart, transactions table, payment breakdown)
  - Responsive layout

- **Day 3-4 (6-8 hours) OR Post-Demo:** Landing Page
  - Template-based implementation for speed
  - Five sections (nav, hero, education, products, about)
  - Brand integration (colors, typography, logo)

**Critical Path:** Store → Dashboard → Landing (in that priority order)
