# Risks and Assumptions

**Assumptions:**

- ✅ Client will provide product images, descriptions, and pricing data
- ✅ Supabase free tier is sufficient for demo and early operations
- ✅ Stripe Connect setup can be completed within timeline
- ✅ Brand assets (logo, color palette, fonts) are ready to use
- ✅ Mock data is acceptable for demo analytics

**Risks & Mitigation:**

- ⚠️ **Timeline slippage:** Mitigation = ruthless scope cutting, landing page is expendable
- ⚠️ **Stripe integration complexity:** Mitigation = show payment UI without full backend for demo
- ⚠️ **Client data delays:** Mitigation = use placeholder products if needed, swap in real data pre-demo
- ⚠️ **Scope creep:** Mitigation = "Apps > Landing Page" mantra, reference brainstorming decisions

**Open Questions:**

- What is Nixtia's geographic delivery range?
- How many SKUs (products) in initial catalog?
- Preferred delivery coordination method post-order?
- Branding guidelines beyond colors/fonts (tone, imagery style)?
